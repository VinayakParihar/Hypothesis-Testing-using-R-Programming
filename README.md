# Hypothesis-Testing-using-R-Programming

Hyothesis testing is the method to test our theory and check our results of an experiment to be true or not. It is a type of statistical analysis in which you put your assumptions about a population parameter to the test.
In simple words it is a guess about a true population parameter and we have to check wether the guess is correct or not.

## There are two types of hypothesis that you can form

### 1) Null hypothesis (Ho)
- It is a hypothesis that nullifies our claim .
- Eg: Suppose out claim is income has significant impact on consumption . Here our null hupothesis will be set to, Ho = 0
- It doesnt always have to be Ho = 0 , rather it can be anything that nullifies our claim. A hypothesis that assumes no differece between sample and the population parameter . Eg B' = B

### 2) Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)
- It is basically the opposite/alternative of null hypothesis
- Eg: if Ho = 0 , then Ha:  B not = 0



Hypothesis testing procesure follows like this:-
Step 1: State your null and alternate hypothesis
Step 2: Collect data 
or we can test result of an analysis . eg coefficient B after a regression analysis.
Step 3: Perform a statistical test . Eg T test
Step 4: Decide whether to reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis. Eg. Compare calculated T test with Tabulated T test values for a given significance value.
Step 5: Present your findings
